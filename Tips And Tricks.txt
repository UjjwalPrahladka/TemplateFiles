greedy ?

dp ? constraints too much ? upperbound on constraint is less?

brute force ? not many iterations required ? root(n) split ? 1 precal 2 solve

binary search ? 

edge cases ? 0 ? 1 ? negative?

find the least number? how about iterate on bits? choose 0 whenever possible?
build trie to simulate?
